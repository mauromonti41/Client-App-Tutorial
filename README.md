# Client-App-Tutorial

This repository regards a simple iOS Client App that let's you operate different CRUD operations on a dedicated Database. The project contained in this repository should be considered together with the one of the Server Side App which defines the REST APIs implemented to communicate and receive (or update) datas contained inside the database.

The Client App in this repository allows you to retrieve a list of songs names from a database that you can edit by adding new ones, deleting or updating the existing ones.

To find out more about the two projects and the main topics related I invite you to read my Medium Article:
